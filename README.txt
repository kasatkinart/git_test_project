This is a test project where i want to test different git commands in terminal;
this is my first hard study of git using terminal and not using opportunities of Pycharm.

If you see this message, then git pull --rebase was completed successfully.

I want to test the difference between master and develop branch by adding few commits in each of these branches.

This is README for develop branch.
